# Hi there! 👋

I’m a self-taught developer and designer working on projects for the community, mainly focused on Degenesis implementation for Foundry VTT, along with smaller apps, graphics, and text layout. Most of my work is open-source and free to use, aiming to support gamers, creators, and hobbyists alike.

## ⚙️Technologies & Tools

- **Programming**: JavaScript + (Vue.js), a bit of Python  
- **Graphics & Design**: Affinity Suite (Designer, Photo, Publisher)

## 🎯 What I Love

- Exploring new tools and technologies
- Building practical solutions for RPGs and tabletop games
- Sharing knowledge and resources with the community



## 💡 Support

If you like my work and want to support future projects, feel free to contribute, open issues, or just say hi!

You can also support me with donations via **Buy Me a Coffee** or any other platform I use – it really helps keep the projects going! ☕💻
